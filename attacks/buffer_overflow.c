/*
 * The code below demonstrates a buffer overflow.
 *
 * This was written solely for the academic purpose of understanding
 * attacks in an effort to be a better defensive programmer.
 *
 * This will probably compile fine with gnu gcc, but if you're having
 * problems where it either won't compile, or you're getting abort traps,
 * you'll need to compile like so:
 *
 * gcc buffer_overflow.c -fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 -o buffer_overflow
 *
 * -fno-stack-protector tells gcc to compile even though you're using a dangerous
 * command (strcpy as opposed to strncopy)
 *
 * -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 tells gcc not to throw the abort trap
 *
 * see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3026361/performing-simple-buffer-overflow-on-mac-os-10-6 for more details
 *
 * Use at your own risk.
